## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I used flexbox to center the qr code box,
setting a width of 100% and a height of 100vh.
The qr code box has a fixed size.
To format the text in the paragraph so that it was on three lines I used the word-spacing property, I don't know if it was the right choice..
